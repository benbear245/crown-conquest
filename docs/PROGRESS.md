# Crown Conquest build progress

## Prompt 1: Foundation

**Built**
- Git repo initialized (branch `main`); `.gitignore` extended for Godot 4 export/editor junk.
- `CLAUDE.md` with the 5-line game summary and the full coding rules from Prompt 1.
- `scripts/balance.gd` autoload (`Balance`) holding every number from `docs/DESIGN.md`: ticks, map sizes, troops, expansion, attack, terrain (plus terrain colours and the Ruins colour), Crown, Keep upgrades, buildings, abilities, fair play, truces, bots, teams, XP, and player colours. `static var` is used for `Packed*Array` tables because constructor calls aren't valid const expressions in GDScript.
- Pure-sim layer under `scripts/sim/`:
  - `game_state.gd` (`GameState`) — owns `terrain` and `owners` as `PackedByteArray`s on a configurable grid, players array, dirty-tile set, seeded RNG. Owner id `255` is reserved for Ruins.
  - `player.gd` (`Player`) — id, name, colour, troops, land, is_alive, bot fields, Crown position, border set, peak_land.
  - `simulation.gd` (`Simulation`) — starts a default 200x120 match, fills plains, adds the local blue player with a radius-4 claim at `(10, height/2)`, and advances the tick count. Ticks only; no node access.
- `scripts/map.gd` (`Map`) — only draws. Builds one `Image` + `ImageTexture` from the `GameState`, repaints only the dirty tiles each frame, lerps owner colour with terrain colour so terrain shows through claimed land.
- `scripts/game.gd` — root `Node2D` script that owns the `Simulation`, drives it at a fixed 10 ticks per second (with a 5-tick spiral-of-death cap), then calls `Map.render()` once per frame.
- `scenes/main.tscn` wires the Map child under the Game root.
- `project.godot` sets landscape orientation, 1920x1080 viewport, `canvas_items`/`expand` stretch, Balance autoload, and `res://scenes/main.tscn` as the main scene.

**What to check**
- Press F5. The window should open landscape and show a plains-coloured 200x120 map scaled to fit, with a blue circle (49 tiles) on the left-centre of the map.
- No parse errors or warnings in the Output panel. The game runs at the project's refresh rate; the sim ticks at 10 Hz regardless.
